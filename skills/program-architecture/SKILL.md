# Program Design

The architecture a partner experiences: what tier they're in, what they get, what they're
paid, and how they get enabled. Program design is where strategy becomes something a partner can
feel. Get it wrong and even well-qualified partners go inactive.

All references are embedded in this skill's `references/` folder.

## When to load this skill

- Standing up a partner program from scratch
- Restructuring tiers or the benefit stack
- Designing partner incentives or an MDF program
- Building the enablement and certification path

## The references

### 1. Tiers & Benefits
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/program-architecture/references/tiers-benefits.md`

How to structure tiers and the benefit stack each earns: the value exchange, requirements, and the
give/get balance that keeps partners investing.

### 2. Incentives & MDF
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/program-architecture/references/incentives-mdf.md`

Partner incentive design (margin, rebates, SPIFFs) and market development funds: how to structure
them so they change behavior instead of subsidizing it.

### 3. Enablement Architecture
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/program-architecture/references/enablement-architecture.md`

The certification ladder and enablement path that turns a signed partner into a producing one, with
the activation checkpoints that matter.

## Calculators

These run on the PartnerImpact connector: `partner_calculator` with the id below, mode `describe`
for the inputs, method and how to read the result, then mode `run`. The list on the tool governs;
this table is a guide to which one answers which question.

| Calculator | Use it to | Id |
|---|---|---|
| Tier & Incentive Designer | What the benefit stack costs per tier, and where incentive runs rich against revenue | `tier-incentive` |
| Tier & Investment Canvas | What each tier costs against what its actual partners return, and attainment against target | `tier-canvas` |
| Per-Partner Quota Setter | Split a partner revenue target into tier-weighted quotas that sum exactly | `quota-setter` |
| MDF Allocation Planner | Split a fixed MDF budget by expected return, against a proportional suggestion | `mdf-planner` |
| Activation-Readiness Scorer | Whether a signed partner is ready to count as active, with gating items | `activation-readiness` |
| 90-Day Onboarding Tracker | Whether onboarding is on track, and which milestones are overdue | `onboarding-tracker` |

## How to use them

Design against the maturity model: don't build tiers a partner base can't fill, or an MDF program
the measurement function can't hold accountable. Every structure ships as a default the user
calibrates.
